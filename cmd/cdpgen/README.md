# cdpgen

The cdpgen tool is used to generate the Golang API for the Chrome Debugging Protocol from the protocol definitions (JSON).

Beware, this tool is not a feat of engineering, it's only purpose is to generate the Golang API. It has gone thourgh many revisions while prototyping the API and might contain both messy and dead code.
